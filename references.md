### 1. Sex-Specific Microglial Memory in Chronic Pain States

**Authors:** Singhal, D., 
**Title:** Sex differences in functional modulation of microglia by early-life physical stress in a rat model of chronic primary low back pain 
**Journal:** European Journal of Physiology, 2025
**DOI:** (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7156472/v1)

**Key Finding:** Demonstrated that males maintain persistent microglial activation following stress exposure, establishing an active "pain memory" at the cellular level, while females exhibit latent sensitization characterized by surveillant but non-activated microglial phenotypes that can be triggered by subsequent stressors.

### 2. Latent vs Manifest Sensitization: A Framework for Personalized Pain Medicine

**Authors:** Singhal, D., Lin, Li., Greffrath, W., Treede R-D  
**Title:** Sex Differences in the Effects of Early Life Stressors in a Rat Model of Myofascial Low Back Pain
**Journal:** European Journal of Pain, 2025  
**DOI:** (https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.70114)

**Key Finding:** Chronic stress differentially modulates neuroimmune signaling cascades in males versus females, contributing to divergent pain phenotypes despite similar clinical presentations. Proposes mechanistic stratification for clinical trial design.
